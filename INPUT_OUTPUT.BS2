' INPUT_OUTPUT.BS2
' This program demonstrates how the input/output direction of a pin is
' determined by the corresponding bit of DIRS. It also shows that the
' state of the pin itself (as reflected by the corresponding bit of PINS)
' is determined by the outside world when the pin is an input, and by the
' corresponding bit of PINS when it's an output. To set up the demo,
' connect a 10k resistor from +5V to P7 on the BASIC Stamp. The resistor
' to +5V puts a high (1) on the pin when it's an input. The BASIC Stamp
' can override this state by writing a low (0) to bit 7 of OUTS and
' changing the pin to output.
