' PWM.bs2
' Connect a voltmeter (such as a digital multimeter set to its voltage
' range) to the output of the circuit shown in the figure for the PWM
' command (in the manual).  Run the program and observe the readings on
' the meter. They should come very close to 1.96V, then decrease slightly
' as the capacitor discharges. Try varying the interval between PWM bursts
' (by changing the PAUSE value) and the number of PWM cycles to see their
' effect.
