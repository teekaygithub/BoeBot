' SHIFTIN.BS2
' This program uses the SHIFTIN instruction to interface with the ADC0831
' 8-bit analog-to-digital converter from National Semiconductor.

Setup:

' In the loop below, just three lines of code are required to read the
' ADC0831. The SHIFTIN command does most of the work.  The mode argument in
' the SHIFTIN command specifies MSB or LSB-first and whether to sample data
' before or after the clock. In this case, we chose MSB-first, post-clock.
' The ADC0831 precedes its data output with a dummy bit, which we take care
' of by specifying 9 bits of data instead of 8.
