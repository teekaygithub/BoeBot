' REVERSE.BS2
' Connect the circuit shown in the REVERSE command description to I/O pin
' 0 and run this program.  The LED will alternate between two states, dim
' and bright. The BASIC Stamp is using the REVERSE command to toggling I/O
' pin 0 between input and output states. When pin 0 is an input, current
' flows through R1, through the LED, through R2 to ground. Pin 0 is
' effectively disconnected and doesn't play a part in the circuit. The total
' resistance encountered by current flowing through the LED is R1 + R2 = 1220
' ohms. When pin 0 is reversed to an output, current flows through R1, through
' the LED, and into pin 0 to ground (because of the 0 written to OUT0). The
' total resistance encountered by current flowing through the LED is R1,
' 220 ohms. With only 20% of the resistance, the LED glows brighter.
